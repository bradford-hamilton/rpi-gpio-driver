##### Linux kernel module for Raspberry Pi 4 Model B GPIO interactions running Ubuntu server 22.04 LTS 64 bit
##### Currently sets up /proc/gpiobuf which then is intended to be written to with a single unsigned 8-bit int - that number is then displayed in binary on a breadboard with 8 LEDs which are connected over GPIO pins on the Rpi
